## Suggestions for Improving the Weather Forecast Widget

To further improve this weather forecast widget in TypeScript, I would use more advanced TypeScript features such as `enums` for the weather condition codes. This would make the code clearer and there will be less chances of errors compared to using plain numbers. I could also improve the UI making it look for attractive and different from the usual weather widget making it unique thus, improving user expereince 

Moreover, I can break the code into smaller parts like having one small part for fetching data another for rendering the UI and another for utility functions. This would make the project more maintainable as it grows.

To further increase the UX, I could add loading states while waiting for the weather data and display helpful error messages if the API fails. Also, i can add more weather codes and reduce the chances of returning the question mark when the weather code is unknown.

I can also test the website with real users and gather actual feedback to make changes
